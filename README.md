# STConvLSTM

This is a Pytorch implementation of STConvLSTM, a spatiotemporal network for radar echo extrapolation in the following paper:

**Spatiotemporal Convolutional LSTM for Radar Echo Extrapolation**, by Shuxin Zhong, Xianxin Zeng, Qing Ling, Qiushi Wen, Weiguang Meng and Yerong Feng.

# Setup 
Required python libraries: Pytorch (>=1.3) + opencv + numpy 

# Dataset
We conduct experiments on two datasets: Moving-MNIST and regional radar echo dataset.

# Trainging
Use the run.py script to train the model.

`python run.py`
